# Vite UI environment variables

# Base URL for Laravel API.
# Dev: typically '/api' (proxied via VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET)
# Prod: UI uses relative '/api' and relies on Nginx template + API_BASE_URL env on the container.
VITE_API_BASE=/api

# Dev server-only: where Vite proxies API requests during development.
# This should point directly at the Laravel backend service (Nginx) in Docker.
# docker-compose.yml (dev) sets this to http://web (the Nginx service for Laravel).
# Not used in production builds.
VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://web

# Public asset base for uploaded files (leave as /storage in Docker; set full URL in production).
VITE_ASSET_BASE=/storage
