# Vite UI environment variables

# Base URL for Laravel API.
# Dev: typically '/api' (proxied via VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET)
# Prod: full URL to Laravel backend (e.g., https://api.example.com)
VITE_API_BASE=/api

# Dev server-only: where Vite proxies API requests during development.
# This should point directly at the Laravel backend service.
# docker-compose.dev.yml sets this to http://web (the Laravel container).
# Not used in production builds.
VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:8000
