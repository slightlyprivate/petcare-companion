# Vite UI environment variables

# Base URL for upstream Laravel API (used by http.api). Default '/api'.
# In production builds, this must be non-empty.
VITE_API_BASE=/api

# Base URL for the BFF/Proxy (used by http.proxy).
# In local dev via Vite proxy you can leave this empty (relative),
# but in production builds this MUST be set to the absolute origin of the BFF.
# Example: http://localhost:5174 or https://frontend.example.com
VITE_PROXY_BASE=

# Dev server-only: where Vite proxies API/BFF requests during development.
# This should point at the BFF container/service.
# docker-compose.dev.yml sets this to http://frontend:3000.
VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:5174
