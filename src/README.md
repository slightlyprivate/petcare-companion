## 🚀 Quick Start

 Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

 Setup (3 minutes)

 ```bash
 # 1) Copy environment configuration (from repo root)
 cp .env.example .env

 # 2) Start containers (from repo root)
 docker-compose up -d

 # 3) Run migrations and seeders
 docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
 docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed

 # 4) Configure Stripe environment (for payment features)
 echo "STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here" >> .env
 echo "STRIPE_SECRET=sk_test_your_secret_here" >> .env
 echo "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret" >> .env

 # 5) Run tests to verify
 docker-compose exec app php artisan test
 ```

## 📧 Mail Configuration (Development)

 The application uses OTP-based authentication. Emails are configured to use Laravel's log driver for development:

 ```bash
 docker-compose exec app tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
 ```

 Mail Configuration Details

- Driver: Log (writes to `storage/logs/laravel.log`)
- From Address: `noreply@petcare.local`
- No external mail server required for development

## 💳 Payment & Gift Economy

 Stripe Checkout is used for virtual credit purchases. Use test keys in `.env`.

 Gift economy features include virtual credits, server-enforced pricing, wallet management, transaction history, webhooks, and status tracking.

 Credit conversion is centralized in `App\\Constants\\CreditConstants`.
